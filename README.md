# AutoOpenItems

Just a simple add-on that does what the title says.

Automatically opens white listed containers as you loot (as soon as you are out of combat).

NOTE: Due to API changes in Wrath, "UseContainerItem" no longer works on clams. Likely has something to do with the Clam Weaving patch.

I didn't create this add-on, I just updated it for TBC.

Looking around CurseForge, it looks like code was heavily borrowed from KAutoOpen.
