# AutoOpenItems

Just a simple add-on that does what the title says.

‚öôÔ∏è Automatically opens containers in your inventory under the following conditions:

- You are not in combat.
- The container is not locked.
- The container did not drop off a raid boss.
- The container is tradable, but does not contain a BoP item.
- The container is tradable, but does not contain a unique item.
- You do not have a Merchant Window Open.
- You do not have your Bank Window Open.
- You do not have your Guild Bank Window Open.
- You do not have your Mailbox Window Open.

### How It Works

AutoOpenItems looks for [items on the whitelist](https://github.com/Gogo1951/AutoOpenItems/blob/main/AutoOpenItems.lua#L7) (containers that meet the above stated criteria), and runs a the "[C_Container.UseContainerItem](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/API_C_Container.UseContainerItem)" public API call on those items to open them as soon as they land in your inventory. 

üö´ NOTE: Due to API changes in Wrath, "UseContainerItem" no longer works on clams. Likely has something to do with the "Clam Weaving" hack.

Looking around CurseForge, it looks like bulk of the original code came from kAutoOpen.
